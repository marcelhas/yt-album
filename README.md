# yt-album

Download an album from Youtube and split it into sections.

## Setup

`yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are required to run this script.

```bash
# Both should return some information.
ffmpeg --version
yt-dlp --version
```

If you use nix you can run:

```bash
nix develop
# Or if you use direnv
direnv allow
```

## Usage

> Make sure that URLs do not contain any weird backslashes.

```bash
./yt-album.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmvUFhjZdFc
```

Your sections will be placed into `./sections/`.

If Youtube does not provide section information then you need to manually
define how to split the album into sections.
Have a look at the comment section/description of your album, often there
will be a comment in the correct format.

Copy `sections.template.txt` and make your edits,
while following its format. Empty lines are ignored.
